            "content": "Trump’s 28-point Ukraine plan in full: What it means, could it work?\nThe US-brokered proposal requires Kyiv to make territorial concessions to Russia and to stay out of NATO.\nThe United States has revealed all 28 points of its proposal to end the Russia-Ukraine war to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The plan, which has been heavily criticised as far too favourable to Russia by many observers, is in its draft stage and has yet to be made public. However, a Ukrainian official is understood to have provided the details to international media.\nHere is a closer look at the points and the significance of this plan.\nWhat are the 28 points of Trump’s proposal for Ukraine?\n1. Ukraine’s sovereignty will be confirmed.\n2. A comprehensive, non-aggression agreement will be concluded between Russia, Ukraine and Europe. All ambiguities of the last 30 years will be considered settled.\n3. It is expected that Russia will not invade neighbouring countries and NATO will not expand further.\n4. A dialogue will be held between Russia and NATO, mediated by the US, to resolve all security issues and create conditions for de-escalation to ensure global security and increase opportunities for cooperation and future economic development.\n5. Ukraine will receive reliable security guarantees.\n6. The size of the Armed Forces of Ukraine will be limited to 600,000 personnel.\n7. Ukraine agrees to enshrine in its constitution that it will not join NATO, and NATO agrees to include in its statutes a provision that Ukraine will not be admitted in the future.\n8. NATO agrees not to station troops in Ukraine.\n9. European fighter jets will be stationed in Poland.\n10. The US security guarantee will have the following caveats:\n- The US will receive compensation for the guarantee;\n- If Ukraine invades Russia, it will lose the guarantee;\n- If Russia invades Ukraine, in addition to a decisive coordinated military response, all global sanctions will be reinstated, recognition of the new territory and all other benefits of this deal will be revoked;\n- If Ukraine launches a missile at Moscow or Saint Petersburg without cause, the security guarantee will be deemed invalid.\n11. Ukraine is eligible for European Union (EU) membership and will receive short-term preferential access to the EU market while this issue is being considered.\n12. A powerful global package of measures will be provided to rebuild Ukraine, including but not limited to:\n- The creation of a Ukraine Development Fund to invest in fast-growing industries, including technology, data centres and artificial intelligence.\n- The US will cooperate with Ukraine to jointly rebuild, develop, modernise and operate Ukraine’s gas infrastructure, including pipelines and storage facilities.\n- Joint efforts to rehabilitate war-affected areas for the restoration, reconstruction and modernisation of cities and residential areas.\n- Infrastructure development.\n- Extraction of minerals and natural resources.\n- The World Bank will develop a special financing package to accelerate these efforts.\n13. Russia will be reintegrated into the global economy:\n- The lifting of sanctions will be discussed and agreed upon in stages and on a case-by-case basis.\n- The US will enter into a long-term economic cooperation agreement for mutual development in the areas of energy, natural resources, infrastructure, artificial intelligence, data centres, rare earth metal extraction projects in the Arctic, and other mutually beneficial corporate opportunities.\n- Russia will be invited to rejoin the G8.\n14. Frozen funds will be used as follows:\n- $100bn in frozen Russian assets will be invested in US-led efforts to rebuild and invest in Ukraine;\n- The US will receive 50 percent of the profits from this venture. Europe will add $100bn to increase the amount of investment available for Ukraine’s reconstruction. Frozen European funds will be unfrozen. The remainder of the frozen Russian funds will be invested in a separate US-Russian investment vehicle that will implement joint projects in specific areas. This fund will be aimed at strengthening relations and increasing common interests to create a strong incentive not to return to conflict.\n15. A joint American-Russian working group on security issues will be established to promote and ensure compliance with all provisions of this agreement.\n16. Russia will enshrine in law its policy of non-aggression towards Europe and Ukraine.\n17. The US and Russia will agree to extend the validity of treaties on the non-proliferation and control of nuclear weapons, including the START I Treaty.\n18. Ukraine agrees to be a non-nuclear state in accordance with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).\n19. The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant will be launched under the supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and the electricity produced will be distributed equally between Russia and Ukraine, 50:50.\n20. Both countries undertake to implement educational programmes in schools and society aimed at promoting understanding and tolerance of different cultures and eliminating racism and prejudice:\n- Ukraine will adopt EU rules on religious tolerance and the protection of linguistic minorities.\n- Both countries will agree to abolish all discriminatory measures and guarantee the rights of Ukrainian and Russian media and education.\n- All Nazi ideology and activities must be rejected and prohibited.\n21. Territories:\n- Crimea, Luhansk and Donetsk will be recognised as de facto Russian, including by the US.\n- Kherson and Zaporizhia will be frozen along the line of contact, which will mean de facto recognition along the line of contact.\n- Russia will relinquish other agreed territories it controls outside the five regions.\n- Ukrainian forces will withdraw from the part of Donetsk oblast that they currently control, and this withdrawal zone will be considered a neutral demilitarised buffer zone, internationally recognised as territory belonging to the Russian Federation. Russian forces will not enter this demilitarised zone.\n22. After agreeing on future territorial arrangements, both the Russian Federation and Ukraine undertake not to change these arrangements by force. Any security guarantees will not apply in the event of a breach of this commitment.\n23. Russia will not prevent Ukraine from using the Dnipro River for commercial activities, and agreements will be reached on the free transport of grain across the Black Sea.\n24. A humanitarian committee will be established to resolve outstanding issues:\n- All remaining prisoners and bodies will be exchanged on an “all for all” basis.\n- All civilian detainees and hostages will be returned, including children.\n- A family reunification programme will be implemented.\n- Measures will be taken to alleviate the suffering of the victims of the conflict.\n25. Ukraine will hold elections in 100 days.\n26. All parties involved in this conflict will receive full amnesty for their actions during the war and agree not to make any claims or consider any complaints in the future.\n27. This agreement will be legally binding. Its implementation will be monitored and guaranteed by the Peace Council, headed by President Donald J Trump. Sanctions will be imposed for violations.\n28. Once all parties agree to this memorandum, the ceasefire will take effect immediately after both sides retreat to the agreed points to begin implementation of the agreement.\nHow has Ukraine reacted to these proposals?\nZelenskyy met with US Army officials in Kyiv on Thursday to discuss the proposals, which have been drawn up by US and Russian officials without any input from Ukraine or its European allies.\nAfter the meeting, Zelenskyy said in an address: “The American side presented points of a plan to end the war – their vision. I outlined our key principles. We agreed that our teams will work on the points to ensure it’s all genuine.”\nZelenskyy added, “From the first days of the war, we have upheld one very simple position: Ukraine needs peace. A real peace – one that will not be broken by a third invasion. A dignified peace – with terms that respect our independence, our sovereignty and the dignity of the Ukrainian people.”\nThe Ukrainian president said that he will now discuss the proposals with Ukraine’s European allies.\nDoes this mean Ukraine and its allies will accept the proposal?\nNo.\n“Zelenskyy had a nuanced response – he said ‘We will work on it’,” Keir Giles, a Eurasia expert at the London political think tank Chatham House, told Al Jazeera.\nHowever, he added that agreeing to the terms of the plan in its current form would be “catastrophic” for Ukraine because of the heavy concessions Kyiv is being asked to make.\nEuropean leaders have indicated that they will not accept a plan that requires Ukraine to make such huge concessions.\n“Ukrainians want peace – a just peace that respects everyone’s sovereignty, a durable peace that can’t be called into question by future aggression,” said French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot. “But peace cannot be a capitulation.”\nUltimately, Zelenskyy has a tricky choice to make in the face of pressure from the US to accept a deal which favours Russia, experts said.\n“The winner here is the US as an arbiter. Russia gets maybe 70 percent of what it wants, Ukraine gets other things which, considering the situation on the battlefield, it could be worse,” Marina Miron, a postdoctoral researcher at the defence studies department at King’s College London, told Al Jazeera.\n“What I think is if Ukraine rejects, then Trump will step back and say, well, you are in the way of a peace process, great, fight on. If that happens, then Ukraine might lose more territory, and Europeans cannot substitute for American military support.”\nMiron added that the US could threaten to stop sharing satellite communication data with Ukraine. “There is a certain leverage that the United States has, and I’m sure that it will be used to a certain extent.”\nWhat are Russia and the US saying about this plan now?\nThe US has not made details of the plan public, and officials from Washington have not commented on it.\nRussia has denied that there have been formal consultations between the US and Russia on a peace plan.\n“Consultations are not currently under way. There are contacts, of course, but there is no process that could be called consultations,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said.\nMeanwhile, Hungarian PM and close Trump ally Viktor Orban seemed to back the plan on Friday.\nIn an X post, Orban wrote that Trump’s plan had “gained new momentum”.\n“The American President is a persistent maverick. If he had been President at the time, the war would never have broken out. It is clear that once he sets his mind on something, he does not let it go, and he has certainly set his mind on ending the Russian-Ukrainian war,” Orban wrote.\nPresident @realDonaldTrump's peace initiative has gained new momentum. A 28-point peace plan is on the table, an American negotiating delegation is in Kyiv, and expectations are high worldwide. The American President is a persistent maverick. If he had been President at the time,… pic.twitter.com/J2cagATvc5\n— Orbán Viktor (@PM_ViktorOrban) November 21, 2025\nWhat do analysts say about these proposals?\nExperts said the terms of the 28-point plan and how they would be implemented are far from clear.\n“The terms are unenforceable, nonsensical and vague that they cannot be enforced without months of wrangling,” Giles said.\nFor instance, he said, point 9 states that European fighter jets will be stationed in Poland. However, it is unclear what “European” or “fighter jets” mean.\nGiles said “European” could mean the European Union or European countries. “‘Fighter jets’ is a militarily meaningless term, which provides plenty of room for argument,” he added.\nHow would the US be ‘compensated’ for security guarantees?\nIt is unclear what security guarantees the US is offering Ukraine. Further details of these have not been released.\nPoint 10 states that the “US will receive compensation for the guarantee”. While it is unclear what the specific compensation would be, experts suggest that point 14 may shed some light on this.\nPoint 14 of the plan states that $100bn in frozen Russian assets plus $100bn from Europe would be used for Ukraine’s reconstruction.\nThe plan further states that the US will receive 50 percent of the profits from the reconstruction of Ukraine. It is not specified how these profits would be generated.\nThe plan also states that remaining Russian funds would go into a joint US-Russia investment vehicle for projects to build ties and deter future conflict, again with little detail.\nGiles said this likely refers to about $300bn in Russian Central Bank assets, which have been frozen by the US and European countries since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\nIn October this year, EU leaders suggested a “reparations plan” under which it would use frozen Russian assets to lend Ukraine $164bn to buy European weapons, and for reconstruction.\nGiles said that the point about Russian frozen assets was likely deliberately added by negotiators from Moscow because “Russia has already written off frozen assets abroad, and now is dangling that as a carrot in front of the US”.\nGiles added that, according to earlier plans, however, “those funds were supposed to rebuild Ukraine”.\nHowever, now we don’t know whether the reconstruction will be of a “free Ukraine or Russian efforts of Russification in occupied Ukraine”, he said.\n“There is a talk about critical minerals, both Ukrainian and Russian critical minerals, so it seems like the Americans basically get to operate in Ukraine or participate in Ukraine’s reconstruction, being financed by European and Russian money,” Miron said.\nWould the proposal give Russia amnesty for war crimes?\nPoint 26 of the plan states that all parties involved in the conflict will receive “full amnesty for their actions during the war”.\nIn March 2023, the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin over the illegal deportation of children from Ukraine to Russia.\nThe US cannot unilaterally grant amnesty to an individual convicted of war crimes by an international organisation.\n“Writing off the war, pretending it never happened, rolling back sanctions and ignoring war crimes is just one of the elements of this draft list where the US is assuming the cooperation of the rest of the world,” Giles said.\nHe added that a large number of countries across the world strongly believe in international law, and are likely to push back on this point.\n“If a negotiation like this were to be enforced, then it is the US endorsing the seizure of territory through open arms aggression, and it will be encouragement to other aggressors around the world that they have the US blessing,” Giles warned.\nWhat territory would Ukraine have to concede?\nThe plan says that Crimea, Luhansk and Donetsk would be considered Russian territory.\nDonetsk and Luhansk are collectively called the Donbas region.\nCrimea was seized by Russia from Ukraine in 2014 and remains a matter of dispute.\nAccording to the Institute for the Study of War, overall, Ukraine still controls 14.5 percent of the territory in the Donbas, including parts of Donetsk around the cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk.\nRussia also controls 75 percent of Zaporizhia and Kherson in southern Ukraine, bordering the Black Sea. The plan says that the current battle lines will be frozen in these regions.\nHow would Russia be brought back into the international fold?\nParts of the proposal aim to bring Russia out of the isolation imposed on it by the Western world since it started the Ukraine war.\nPoint 12 states that Russia will be invited to rejoin the G8.\nThe G8 – currently the G7 – was an unofficial forum for the leaders of eight major industrialised nations: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom and the US.\nRussia was part of the G8 but was ejected following the annexation of Crimea in 2014.\nThe plan also mentions the establishment of a US-Russian investment vehicle that would implement joint projects in specific areas. However, further details about this have not been revealed.\nThe plan also mentions the formation of a joint US-Russian working group on security issues to ensure compliance with the plan.\nMiron also said that the US and Russia could reinstate the START I nuclear treaty, followed by economic projects, including in the Arctic. She added that Russia is important to the US because it has critical minerals.\n“It also has a geopolitical weight which Ukraine doesn’t have,” Miron said, referring to Russia’s ties with with countries like China, North Korea, Iran, Venezuela and Cuba.\nWill the proposal end the war in Ukraine?\nAnalysts are doubtful. “This agreement is not going anywhere – similar to the previous ones,” Giles said.\nHe called it “another iteration of the merry-go-round that we’ve been on many times before”.\nHe said he believes the plan will receive pushback from Ukraine and Europe, which will want to negotiate changes."

            "content": "Trump gives Ukraine Thanksgiving deadline to respond to his peace plan\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is under pressure to accept President Donald Trump's 28-point plan to end the nearly four-year-old war with Russia.\nWASHINGTON — President Donald Trump has given Ukraine less than a week to respond to his plan to give up land and reduce the size of its military as part of a peace agreement with Russia that would end their nearly four-year-old war.\nTrump's proposal would see Ukraine give up territory in exchange for security guarantees from the U.S. and a pledge from Russia not to reinvade, putting an official end to the war that Moscow launched in February 2022.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is under pressure from the Trump administration to agree to the 28-point plan that U.S. officials this week formally presented to his government. Moscow has said the plan could form the basis for a peace agreement, while supporters of Ukraine, including prominent members of Republican Party, have bashed it due to the territorial concessions Zelenskyy's government would have to make.\n\"We have a way of getting peace, or we think we have a way of getting to peace. He's going to have to approve it,\" Trump said of Zelenskyy on Nov. 21 in the Oval Office.\nWhat's inside of Trump's 28-point plan to end Russia-Ukraine war\nIf the U.S.-led peace plan remains unchanged, the lines of conflict in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia would be frozen, with Russia retaining almost all of the area it currently occupies.\nThe Crimean peninsula, which Russia annexed in 2014, would remain under Moscow's control. So would the Luhansk and Donetsk areas in eastern Ukraine.\nRussia’s military controls most, but not all, of the Donetsk region — which means it would gain some territory it doesn’t currently occupy. It would get to split the electricity produced by Europe's largest nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia. President Vladimir Putin would also be welcomed back into an elite economic club for advanced economies, alongside the U.S. and its most powerful allies.\nAs punishment for Russia for its unprovoked attack on Ukraine, it would lose financial assets that the U.S. has previously frozen. Under Trump's plan, $100 billion worth of the assets, which are primarialy held in Europe, would be used to rebuild and invest in Ukraine, with the U.S. taking 50% of the profits from this venture. Europe would also pay $100 billion to help with Ukraine's reconstruction.\n\"The remainder of the frozen Russian funds will be invested in a separate US-Russian investment vehicle that will implement joint projects in specific areas,\" the proposal says. \"This fund will be aimed at strengthening relations and increasing common interests to create a strong incentive not to return to conflict.\"\nSanctions would be lifted on a case-by-case basis and Russia would work with the U.S. on artificial intelligence and rare earth metal extraction projects in the Arctic.\nUkraine would be expected to make steep concessions, too. In addition to the land Ukraine would be giving up to Russia, it would forgo a bid for NATO membership and agree to cap its army at 600,000 personnel. As of January, the country had an estimated 880,000 active-duty personnel.\nThe nation would be allowed to join the European Union, and children who were forcibly taken from Ukraine would be returned. Ukraine would have to hold elections within 100 days after their suspension under martial law during the war.\nZelenksyy was elected to a five-year term in 2019 that would have ended in 2024 were it not for the war. He's suggested that he will not run for reelection.\nTrump gives Ukraine until Thanksgiving to assess his plan\nTrump said he’s given Ukraine a loose deadline of Nov. 27 to assess his proposal during a radio interview on Nov. 21.\n\"I've had a lot of deadlines, but if things are working well, you tend to extend the deadlines. But Thursday is we think is an appropriate time,\" Trump said during The Brian Kilmeade Show on Fox News Radio.\nThey were the American president's first public comments on the proposal since Axios revealed its existence earlier this week. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Nov. 20 that Trump backs the plan that was spearheaded by his special envoy Steve Witkoff.\n\"The president supports this plan. It's a good plan for both Russia and Ukraine, and we believe that it should be acceptable to both sides,\" Leavitt announced.\nZelenskyy said in a Nov. 21 address that the pressure on Ukraine to accept a deal has intensified.\n“Ukraine may now face a very difficult choice. Either the loss of dignity, or the risk of losing a key partner. Either the 28 difficult points, or an extremely difficult winter,” Zelenskyy said in translated remarks.\nTrump plan draws a sharp response from Ukraine backers\nTrump's proposal has drawn sharp criticism from Ukraine backers, including some Republicans who are typically aligned with the second-term president.\n“A negotiated settlement that allows Putin to claim victory by recognizing Russia's claim to Ukrainian territory would reverse the progress President Trump made restoring the deterrence lost under Biden,” former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo wrote on X.\nPompeo served in Trump's Cabinet his entire first term.\nSenate Armed Services Chairman Roger Wicker, a Republican who represents Mississippi, said in a statement that the \"so-called ‘peace plan’ has real problems.\" Wicker said that a suggestion in the plan that the U.S. could work with \"a serial liar and killer like Putin\" on nuclear arm control should be treated with skepticism.\n\"Ukraine should not be forced to give up its lands to one of the world’s most flagrant war criminals in Vladimir Putin,\" he said. \"And any assurances provided to Putin should not reward his malign behavior or undermine the security of the United States or allies.\"\nTrump said on Kilmeade’s show that if Ukraine doesn't make a deal now, it will end up losing territory to Russia anyway. The president also dismissed concerns that Putin would set his sights on nearby NATO nations if he isn’t stopped in Ukraine.\n“They’ll be stopped. He’s not looking for more war. He’s taken punishment,” Trump said.\nRussia says Trump plan could be the basis for a settlement\nU.S. officials cast Trump's proposal as a preliminary one that it is workshopping with both nations after it leaked to journalists. The 28-point plan that was obtained by USA TODAY and other news outlets and published online hours after it was formally presented to Ukraine by the Trump administration.\nPutin said on Nov. 21 that Trump's proposal \"could form the basis for a final peace settlement\" but it had not been discussed with Russia in detail. He said that if Ukraine did not consent to the plan, its military would be defeated on the battlefield.\nArmy Secretary Dan Driscoll and a delegation of U.S. military brass discussed the proposal with Zelenskyy during a trip to Kyiv this week.\nZelenskyy said after his meeting with Driscoll that his country does not want to lose America’s support and does not want to be characterized as undermining negotiations. However, he said he continues to believe that Russia does not have a genuine desire for peace.\nZelenskyy consults Ukraine's allies, discusses plan with JD Vance\nThe Ukrainian leader has been holding calls with Western allies and said on Nov. 21 that he spent almost an hour on the phone speaking to Driscoll and Vice President JD Vance discussing the details of the proposal.\n“We’re working to make the path forward dignified and truly effective for achieving a lasting peace,” Zelenskyy said in a post on X. “Ukraine has always respected and continues to respect U.S. President Donald Trump’s desire to put an end to the bloodshed, and we view every realistic proposal positively.”\nVance voted against Ukraine aid as a senator and clashed with Zelenskyy earlier this year in the Oval Office. He’s generally viewed as more isolationist than Trump and said during a Nov. 20 event hosted by Breitbart News that he wants Russia and Ukraine to normalize economic relations.\nContributing: Kim Hjelmgaard"

            "content": "Trump administration's 28-point Ukraine-Russia peace plan presented to Zelenskyy\nThe plan includes items that could be painful for Ukraine to accept.\nThe Trump administration's 28-point draft proposal to finally end Russia's invasion into Ukraine would require Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's government to make significant concessions -- but also includes NATO-style security guarantees for Ukraine, according to a senior U.S. official.\nThe plan, which is still a draft and could change, was presented in Kyiv earlier Thursday.\nThe plan was drafted by Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff with input from Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the White House press secretary and a senior U.S. administration official confirmed Thursday.\nThe plan would force Kyiv to give up additional territory in the east, cap the size of its military and agree it will never join NATO, among a number of other items that will be painful for the war-torn country to swallow.\nEven though the Trump administration plan calls for significant concessions from Ukraine, one of the security guarantees that will be provided to Ukraine is modeled on the principles of Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty. Under the proposed plan, the U.S. and European allies would view an attack on Ukraine as an attack on the \"transatlantic community,\" according to a senior U.S. administration official.\nAxios first reported details of the draft plan.\nOfficially, the 28-point peace plan notes that \"Ukraine will receive reliable security guarantees.\"\nThe senior official confirmed that one of those security guarantees is a NATO-style security guarantee, which means the U.S. and its allies could respond with military force if Russia attacks Ukraine in the future.\nThat could be seen as a huge, unprecedented win for Ukraine and Zelenskyy, who has, for years, sought long-term, collective defense protection from NATO allies.\nThe plan was presented to Zelenskky on Thursday, the U.S. official said.\n\"This plan was drawn up immediately following discussions with one of the most senior members of President Zelensky's administration, Rustem Umerov, who agreed to the majority of the plan, after making several modifications, and presented it to President Zelensky,\" the senior U.S. administration official said to ABC News.\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement provided to ABC News that the plan reflects the complex situation and that both Russia and Ukraine will gain more than they will give.\n\"As the Trump Administration has clearly said, any deal must provide full security guarantees and deterrence for Ukraine, Europe, and Russia to ensure the end of the war, in addition to financial opportunities for Ukraine to rebuild, and for Russia to rejoin the global economy, to benefit the people in both countries,\" Leavitt said in the statement. \"This plan was crafted to reflect the realities of the situation...to find the best win-win scenario, where both parties gain more than they must give.\"\nIn his evening address on Thursday, Zelenskyy said he had a \"very serious conversation\" with U.S. officials who laid out what he called a \"vision\" for ending the war.\nIn his remarks, Zelenskyy reiterated that Ukraine needs a real peace that won't be broken.\n\"I outlined what is fundamentally important for us. And we agreed that the teams will work on these proposals – so that it is real,\" Zelenkskyy said in his address. \"We will not make harsh statements and are committed to clear, honest work – Ukraine, the United States and our friends and partners in Europe and the world.\"\nThe full plan, according to a draft obtained by ABC News:\n1. Ukraine's sovereignty will be confirmed.\n2. A comprehensive non-aggression agreement will be concluded between Russia, Ukraine and Europe. All ambiguities of the last 30 years will be considered settled.\n3. It is expected that Russia will not invade neighboring countries and NATO will not expand further.\n4. A dialogue will be held between Russia and NATO, mediated by the United States, to resolve all security issues and create conditions for de-escalation in order to ensure global security and increase opportunities for cooperation and future economic development.\n5. Ukraine will receive reliable security guarantees.\n6. The size of the Ukrainian Armed Forces will be limited to 600,000 personnel.\n7. Ukraine agrees to enshrine in its constitution that it will not join NATO, and NATO agrees to include in its statutes a provision that Ukraine will not be admitted in the future.\n8. NATO agrees not to station troops in Ukraine.\n9. European fighter jets will be stationed in Poland.\n10. The U.S. guarantee:\n-- The U.S. will receive compensation for the guarantee;\n-- If Ukraine invades Russia, it will lose the guarantee;\n-- If Russia invades Ukraine, in addition to a decisive coordinated military response, all global sanctions will be reinstated, recognition of the new territory and all other benefits of this deal will be revoked;\n-- If Ukraine launches a missile at Moscow or St. Petersburg without cause, the security guarantee will be deemed invalid.\n11. Ukraine is eligible for EU membership and will receive short-term preferential access to the European market while this issue is being considered.\n12. A powerful global package of measures to rebuild Ukraine, including but not limited to:\n-- The creation of a Ukraine Development Fund to invest in fast-growing industries, including technology, data centers, and artificial intelligence.\n-- The United States will cooperate with Ukraine to jointly rebuild, develop, modernize, and operate Ukraine's gas infrastructure, including pipelines and storage facilities.\n-- Joint efforts to rehabilitate war-affected areas for the restoration, reconstruction and modernization of cities and residential areas.\n-- Infrastructure development.\n-- Extraction of minerals and natural resources.\n-- The World Bank will develop a special financing package to accelerate these efforts.\n13. Russia will be reintegrated into the global economy:\n-- The lifting of sanctions will be discussed and agreed upon in stages and on a case-by-case basis.\n-- The United States will enter into a long-term economic cooperation agreement for mutual development in the areas of energy, natural resources, infrastructure, artificial intelligence, data centers, rare earth metal extraction projects in the Arctic, and other mutually beneficial corporate opportunities.\n-- Russia will be invited to rejoin the G8.\n14. Frozen funds will be used as follows:\n-- $100 billion in frozen Russian assets will be invested in US-led efforts to rebuild and invest in Ukraine;\n-- The US will receive 50% of the profits from this venture. Europe will add $100 billion to increase the amount of investment available for Ukraine's reconstruction. Frozen European funds will be unfrozen. The remainder of the frozen Russian funds will be invested in a separate US-Russian investment vehicle that will implement joint projects in specific areas. This fund will be aimed at strengthening relations and increasing common interests to create a strong incentive not to return to conflict.\n15. A joint American-Russian working group on security issues will be established to promote and ensure compliance with all provisions of this agreement.\n16.

Ukraine agrees to be a non-nuclear state in accordance with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.\n19. The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant will be launched under the supervision of the IAEA, and the electricity produced will be distributed equally between Russia and Ukraine -- 50:50.\n20. Both countries undertake to implement educational programs in schools and society aimed at promoting understanding and tolerance of different cultures and eliminating racism and prejudice:\n-- Ukraine will adopt EU rules on religious tolerance and the protection of linguistic minorities.\n-- Both countries will agree to abolish all discriminatory measures and guarantee the rights of Ukrainian and Russian media and education.\n-- All Nazi ideology and activities must be rejected and prohibited.\n21. Territories:\n-- Crimea, Luhansk and Donetsk will be recognized as de facto Russian, including by the United States.\n-- Kherson and Zaporizhzhia will be frozen along the line of contact, which will mean de facto recognition along the line of contact.\n-- Russia will relinquish other agreed territories it controls outside the five regions.\n-- Ukrainian forces will withdraw from the part of Donetsk Oblast that they currently control, and this withdrawal zone will be considered a neutral demilitarized buffer zone, internationally recognized as territory belonging to the Russian Federation. Russian forces will not enter this demilitarized zone.\n22. After agreeing on future territorial arrangements, both the Russian Federation and Ukraine undertake not to change these arrangements by force. Any security guarantees will not apply in the event of a breach of this commitment.\n23. Russia will not prevent Ukraine from using the Dnieper River for commercial activities, and agreements will be reached on the free transport of grain across the Black Sea.\n24. A humanitarian committee will be established to resolve outstanding issues:\n-- All remaining prisoners and bodies will be exchanged on an 'all for all' basis.\n-- All civilian detainees and hostages will be returned, including children.\n-- A family reunification program will be implemented.\n-- Measures will be taken to alleviate the suffering of the victims of the conflict.\n25. Ukraine will hold elections in 100 days.\n26. All parties involved in this conflict will receive full amnesty for their actions during the war and agree not to make any claims or consider any complaints in the future.\n27. This agreement will be legally binding. Its implementation will be monitored and guaranteed by the Peace Council, headed by President Donald J. Trump. Sanctions will be imposed for violations.\n28.

            "content": "Here's what's in the Trump administration's proposed 28-point Russia-Ukraine peace plan\nUpdate: Ukraine said on Nov. 25 that it has agreed to \"the core terms\" of a peace deal brokered by the U.S., amid ongoing talks in Abu Dhabi to work out remaining details. None of the changes to the Trump administration's original 28-point proposal have been released. Read the latest here; our earlier story on the initial proposal is below.\nTrump administration officials have proposed a 28-point peace plan designed to end the Russia-Ukraine war — a framework that would require Ukraine to give up its eastern Donbas region and Crimea, and swear off NATO membership, according to a draft shared publicly by a Ukrainian opposition politician and confirmed by a White House official.\nThe 28-point plan is the most recent working document offered by the administration, reflecting feedback from Russian and Ukrainian officials, the White House official said. It still remains unclear whether both sides will agree to it; diplomatic conversations are ongoing and further changes are being negotiated, according to multiple sources.\nWhile some European governments were aware the U.S. was working on a proposal, they were not involved in drafting it, according to European officials contacted by CBS News.\nThe plan emerged following recent meetings between the U.S. and officials from both Russia and Ukraine. President Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff, met with a key adviser to Russian President Vladimir Putin, Kirill Dmitriev on Oct. 24 in Miami, to develop the plan, CBS News reported Thursday.\nThe plan was also presented to a senior member of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's administration, Rustem Umerov, a White House official said. Umerov confirmed on X that he was party to the talks on a technical level but said, \"I provided no assessments or, even more so, approvals of any points. This is not within my authority and does not correspond to the procedure.\"\nOn Thursday, Zelenskyy met with U.S. Army Secretary Dan Driscoll in Kyiv, and was presented with what he later characterized in a post on X as \"points of a plan to end the war — [America's] vision.\" Zelenskyy said he outlined Ukraine's key principles, and the two sides agreed to continue working on the plan's provisions. A White House official told CBS News that Driscoll had two hours of meetings with Ukrainian officials, including 45 minutes of direct talks with Zelenskyy, which they described as \"productive.\"\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement to CBS News: \"This plan was crafted to reflect the realities of the situation, after 5 years of a devastating war, to find the best win-win scenario, where both parties gain more than they must give.\"\nHere's how the proposed plan would work:\nImmediate ceasefire\nThe plan says a ceasefire would take effect immediately if both sides agree to the deal.\nUkraine expected to give up its eastern regions\nAs written, the plan would allow Russia to hold onto much of the Ukrainian territory that it currently occupies — and take over some Ukrainian-held areas.\nThe plan calls for the Ukrainian oblasts of Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk to be recognized by the U.S. and others as de facto Russian territory. Crimea was fully annexed by Russia in 2014, and the Russian military has occupied most of Donetsk and Luhansk — collectively known as the Donbas — since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022. Parts of the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine were first occupied by Russian-aligned forces in 2014.\nCrucially, parts of Donetsk that are still under Ukrainian control would also be ceded to Russia, according to the proposal, but would be deemed a neutral buffer zone with no Russian military presence.\nThe conflict would be frozen at the existing front lines in two other Ukrainian oblasts — Kherson and Zaporizhia — effectively allowing Russia to hold onto cities like Mariupol and retain a land connection to Crimea.\nThose terms could prove to be a sticking point for Ukraine. Zelenskyy has long refused to give up any new territory or recognize Russian control over Crimea, instead calling for the war to be paused on the existing conflict lines.\nUkraine must cap its military size\nThe proposal also calls for Ukraine to cap the size of its military at 600,000 people.\nZelensky said in January that the country's military numbered 880,000, according to the Kyiv Independent. Six years earlier, it had roughly 250,000 troops, the Atlantic Council said.\nNo to NATO membership — but Ukraine can join the EU\nUnder the plan, Ukraine would be barred from joining NATO.\nThe country would be expected to modify its constitution to specify that it will not join the 32-nation bloc, a change of course since the country's NATO aspirations are currently enshrined in its constitution. Ukraine has pursued NATO membership for years, a status that would require the United States and other members to come to the country's defense if it's attacked again.\nAnd NATO is expected to agree not to accept Ukraine into the alliance. In 2008, its member states issued a declaration agreeing that Ukraine would become a member of NATO at some point in the future, but it did not set out a timeline.\nThe plan also calls for NATO to agree not to send troops to Ukraine — possibly scuttling any postwar security deal that involves placing allied troops on Ukrainian soil.\nAnother point in the plan says Russia will not invade neighboring countries and NATO will not expand any further — a favorable point for Russia, which has long chafed at the alliance's post-Cold War expansions. Sweden and Finland are the alliance's newest members, joining in 2024 and 2023, respectively, partly in reaction to the Russia-Ukraine war.\nNATO's longstanding position is that it has an \"open door policy,\" and decisions to admit new countries are made by its members, not any other countries.\nBut the plan does specify that Ukraine has a right to join the European Union, and that it would get access to the European market in the meantime. Russia has long been wary of further economic and political integration between Ukraine and Europe.\nA U.S. guarantee\nThe plan lays out a security guarantee if Russia reinvades Ukraine, calling for a \"decisive coordinated military response\" and the reinstatement of sanctions on Russia. Other benefits from the agreement, including recognition of new Russian territory, would be called off as well. The plan does not specify what type of military response Russia would face.\nThe guarantee would be terminated if Ukraine invades Russia, or if it launches missiles at Moscow or St. Petersburg.\nUkrainian elections\nUkraine would be expected to hold elections in 100 days. Ukraine had elections scheduled for early 2024, but they were delayed due to the war. Zelenskyy won the presidency in 2019.\nEconomic plan for Ukraine, Russian sanctions lifted\nThe plan calls for a recovery plan for Ukraine, whose economy has been devastated by a yearslong Russian invasion and aerial bombardment. That includes reconstruction of Ukrainian cities, a development fund to boost Ukraine's tech industry and investments in mining and gas.\nSome $100 billion in frozen Russian assets would be invested in Ukraine, with the U.S. leading that effort. Europe would contribute an additional $100 billion.\nThe plan also calls for negotiations on lifting the hefty sanctions that Russia has faced since the invasion began, choking it off from much of the global economy. The sanctions would be lifted in stages, according to the framework. And frozen Russian assets beyond $100 billion would be plowed into a joint U.S.-Russia investment fund.\nThe overall plan would be monitored and enforced by a Peace Council, to be chaired by President Trump.\nOther points in the plan include a Russia-NATO security dialogue, a joint U.S.-Russia security working group and a non-aggression pact between Russia, Ukraine and Europe. It would also extend U.S.-Russia arms control treaties, require Ukraine to be a non-nuclear state and bar Russia from blocking Ukraine from using the key Dnipro river for commercial purposes.\nAll civilian detainees taken during the war would be returned, including children, and both sides in the conflict would be granted amnesty for their conduct during the war. And both countries would be expected to adopt educational programs to discourage racial prejudice.\nThe plan also calls for a return of Russia to the Group of Eight, a grouping of powerful countries that kicked Russia out after its 2014 annexation of Crimea.\nLeavitt said in her statement: \"As the Trump Administration has clearly said, any deal must provide full security guarantees and deterrence for Ukraine, Europe, and Russia to ensure the end of the war, in addition to financial opportunities for Ukraine to rebuild, and for Russia to rejoin the global economy, to benefit the people in both countries.\""

            "content": "U.S. President Donald Trump is pressing Ukraine to accept a new peace proposal built around sweeping Russian demands, giving Kyiv until Nov. 27 to decide whether it will accept the demands or lose American support.\nThe push marks Trump's latest attempt to end Russia's all-out war, now approaching its fourth year, and as President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Nov. 21, \"Ukraine may soon face an extremely difficult choice. Either the loss of dignity or the risk of losing a key partner.\"\nThe Kyiv Independent unpacks why this new U.S. push is different in substance, timing, and the people driving it.\nWhat is the 28-point peace plan for Ukraine?\nAt the center of Trump's proposal is a sweeping territorial concession: Ukraine would surrender the entire eastern Donbas region — both Russian-occupied areas and the parts still controlled by Ukrainian troops.\nWhile Russia has occupied all but a few villages in Luhansk Oblast, Ukraine continues to hold significant parts of Donetsk Oblast, including key cities Pokrovsk, Sloviansk, and Kramatorsk.\nUnder the plan, Ukrainian forces would withdraw from these remaining areas, which would then be designated a demilitarized zone.\nThe territory would be internationally recognized as belonging to Russia, though Russian troops would be prohibited from entering the zone.\nThe framework also envisions de facto recognition of Russia's control over Crimea, Luhansk, and Donetsk — not by Ukraine, but by the United States.\nKherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts would be frozen along the current front line, locking in Moscow's advances.\nUkraine's Armed Forces would be capped at 600,000. Kyiv would pause its NATO aspirations and agree not to host foreign troops, remaining a non-nuclear state.\nIn return, the Kremlin would pledge not to attack Ukraine or other European countries and codify that commitment in Russian law.\nBut Russian President Vladimir Putin has a history of bending Russia's legal framework — first to extend presidential terms, then to nullify them — raising doubts that such a pledge would endure.\nThe economic component of the plan is ambiguous.\nIt calls for Russia's reintegration into the global economy, lifting sanctions in stages while launching U.S.-Russia cooperation on energy, infrastructure, artificial intelligence, and rare-earth projects. Russia would eventually return to what is now the G7.\nFrozen Russian assets would be partially redirected to rebuild Ukraine — matched by European contributions — while the rest would finance joint U.S.-Russian ventures.\nWestern governments froze around $300 billion in Russian sovereign assets following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Kyiv has repeatedly urged the G7 and EU to move from freezing to confiscating those funds and using them to finance Ukraine's defense.\nAt the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, currently under Russian occupation, the plan proposes restarting operations under International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) oversight. Electricity would be split equally between Russia and Ukraine.\nBefore Russia seized the nuclear power plant in 2022, the plant generated around 20% of Ukraine's electricity.\nThe plan also includes a U.S. security commitment: Any future Russian attack would trigger a \"decisive coordinated military response,\" alongside the immediate reinstatement of sanctions.\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told the Kyiv Independent that the proposal aims to provide \"full security guarantees and deterrence\" while creating financial opportunities for Ukraine's reconstruction and Russia's reentry into the global economy.\n\"This plan was crafted to reflect the realities of the situation... to find the best win-win scenario, where both parties gain more than they must give,\" she added.\nPutin said that the proposal had been under discussion during the Alaska meeting, claiming Washington had asked Moscow to \"show flexibility\" — and that Russia agreed.\nHe described the 28-point document as a \"modernized\" version of those earlier talks.\nPutin added that the U.S. has not discussed the plan publicly beyond broad outlines, but argued it could serve as a basis for negotiations with Ukraine.\nWho is behind this plan?\nU.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff has been shaping the plan in direct coordination with Kirill Dmitriev, Russia's top economic negotiator and one of the Kremlin's main backchannel operators, according to a source in Ukraine's President's Office.\nA senior U.S. official told the Kyiv Independent that Witkoff spent the past month collecting feedback from both Kyiv and Moscow.\nBut his involvement runs deeper.\nThe Kyiv Independent has learned from a source familiar with the matter that he is operating a shadow channel inside the White House with Dmitriev, undermining pro-Ukraine figures.\nA real estate mogul before entering government, Witkoff has no diplomatic background, yet has become one of the central architects of a proposal that closely resembles the Kremlin's terms.\nWhat makes the timing of this peace proposal different from previous plans?\nThis proposal arrives at a moment of acute pressure for Ukraine — militarily, politically, and economically.\nOn the battlefield, Russian forces continue advancing toward Pokrovsk, the main target of Moscow's offensive. The city has become the center of a 10–15 kilometer (5–10 mile) \"killzone,\" where Russian strikes have cut off Ukrainian supply routes, forcing troops to travel on foot.\nProminent activist Serhii Sternenko warned on Nov. 17 that Ukraine faces a \"disaster of strategic magnitude,\" citing repeated failures to build fortifications and prepare new defensive lines.\n\"Our defense is falling apart,\" Sternenko, who works closely with various military units to supply their immediate needs, such as drones, said. \"Under a stunning silence about it.\"\nRussian forces have even opened sudden fronts this year in Dnipropetrovsk and Sumy oblasts.\nThe Kyiv Independent also learned from a senior U.S. official that Washington views Ukraine's worsening energy situation as urgent. Russia continues to strike the power grid ahead of winter.\nBut the political pressure may be even heavier.\nUkraine is reeling from a corruption scandal — the largest of Zelensky's tenure.\nThe scandal stems from an investigation alleging that Timur Mindich, a close Zelensky ally, ran a scheme skimming kickbacks from energy construction and procurement — including projects to fortify Ukraine's energy infrastructure — and laundering the profits.\nEight suspects have been charged, including figures tied to presidential associates and several ministers. National Security and Defense Council Secretary Rustem Umerov is under investigation, though he has not been charged.\nA Kyiv Independent source familiar with the U.S. proposal said the Kremlin has hardened its maximalist conditions, sensing Ukraine's worsening position on the front lines and exploiting the fallout from the corruption scandal.\nAgainst this backdrop, Trump appears unusually impatient.\n\"I've had a lot of deadlines,\" Trump told Fox News. \"But Thursday is it.\"\nUmerov controversy\nDaria Kaleniuk, executive director of the Anti-Corruption Action Center (AntAC), told the Kyiv Independent that Umerov has been representing Ukraine in the ongoing peace talks.\nThe plan's rollout has already caused turbulence in Kyiv. A senior U.S. official contradicted Umerov's earlier claim that he had not modified any clauses in the peace plan.\nThe issue centers on a point that originally proposed an audit of all international aid to Ukraine.\nIn a later version, the clause was altered to offer \"full amnesty for actions during the war\" for all parties, including Russia, despite its widespread, well-documented war crimes.\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that Ukraine changed the clause, with its correspondent Yaroslav Trofimov saying Umerov was responsible.\nUmerov, who earlier served as defense minister, dismissed the reports as \"unverified information,\" saying he only organized meetings and did not approve or change any points.\nBut the senior U.S. official told the Kyiv Independent this was false.\n\"This plan was drawn up immediately following discussions with one of the most senior members of Zelensky's administration, Umerov, who agreed to the majority of the plan, after making several modifications, and presented it to Zelensky,\" the official said.\nWhen asked why Umerov would push for such a change, a pro-government Ukrainian lawmaker told the Kyiv Independent that \"maybe it's related to the investigation.\"\nA source in the President's Office told the Kyiv Independent that reports about Umerov signing on the plan \"are fake.\"\nWhat was Zelensky's reaction?\nUkraine's President's Office confirmed on Nov. 21 that Zelensky has received \"a draft plan which, according to the American side, could revitalize diplomacy.\"\nThe Ukrainian president avoided rejecting the plan outright.\nAfter his meeting with U.S. Army Secretary Dan Driscoll, who was visiting Kyiv, Zelensky said teams from Ukraine and the U.S. will work on points of the plan to end the war.\n\"Ukraine may soon face an extremely difficult choice.\"\n\"We are ready for constructive, honest, and efficient work,\" he added.\nIn a national address on Nov. 21, he said Ukraine is facing \"one of the most difficult moments,\" describing the diplomatic environment as \"complicated\" and acknowledging the risk of damaging key alliances.\n\"Ukraine may soon face an extremely difficult choice,\" he said.\n\"Either 28 complicated points or the hardest winter yet — and the risks that follow.\"\nHe said Ukraine's position will be based on national priorities.\n\"We will pursue a calm dialogue with America and all of our partners,\" he added. \"There will be a constructive search for solutions with our main partner.\"\nWhat are Ukraine's allies saying?\nThe Kyiv Independent learned from multiple sources that European partners were not included in drafting the U.S. plan — nor was Ukraine.\nZelensky held a phone call with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, French President Emmanuel Macron, and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Nov. 21, discussing both the U.S. plan and the broader European security picture.\n\"We are working on a document prepared by the American side. It should be a plan that will ensure a real and dignified peace,\" Zelensky said after the call.\nEU foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, warned that any peace plan must include Ukraine and Europe.\n\"We have not heard of any concessions on the Russian side. If Russia really wanted peace, it could have agreed to an unconditional ceasefire already some time ago,\" she said.\nWhat happens next?\nIn his address, Zelensky warned Ukrainians that the coming week \"will be very difficult and eventful,\" with political and information pressure intensifying.\nKyiv plans to \"work\" with the U.S. and search for \"constructive solutions,\" he added.\nWith Trump's deadline to sign the peace deal by Thanksgiving looming, the next steps are uncertain — and closely watched in Kyiv, Washington, and Moscow."

            "content": "Trump's 28-point Ukraine peace plan in full\nThe document states Ukraine must cede land it currently controls. The plan closely resembles the list of demands repeatedly outlined by Vladimir Putin.\nMonday 24 November 2025 08:23, UK\nDonald Trump's plan for ending the war in Ukraine would hand swathes of land to Russia and limit the size of Kyiv's military, a draft has revealed.\nThe copy of the proposal that originates from negotiations between Washington and Moscow was obtained by the Associated Press and appears emphatically favourable to Russia.\nIt closely resembles the list of demands repeatedly stated by the Kremlin since it launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine nearly four years ago.\nPoints included in the plan are widely seen as untenable for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who has rejected Mr Trump's previous calls for territorial concessions.\nSince the draft was made, the US has said it is making \"some changes\" after seemingly positive talks with Ukraine, while Britain, France and Germany have drafted a European counter proposal peace plan which is also 28 points, including suggested changes and deletions.\nThe US-Russia draft was reportedly devised by Trump negotiator Steve Witkoff and Kremlin official Kirill Dmitriev.\nIt says there would be a \"decisive coordinated military response\" in the event of further Russian incursions onto Ukrainian territory, but does not say what role the United States would play in that response.\nA side agreement aims to satisfy Ukrainian security concerns by saying a future \"significant, deliberate and sustained armed attack\" by Russia would be viewed as \"threatening the peace and security of the transatlantic community\".\nThe agreement - detailed to the AP by an unnamed senior US official - does not obligate the US or European allies to intervene on Ukraine's behalf, although it says they would \"determine the measures necessary to restore security\".\nThe 28-point plan states Ukraine must cede the entirety of Crimea, Luhansk and Donetsk to Russia - despite Ukraine still controlling a third of the latter. Kherson and Zaporizhzhia would be frozen along the existing lines of conflict.\nUkraine's army, currently at roughly 880,000 troops, would be reduced to 600,000.\nSome frozen Russian assets would go toward rebuilding Ukraine, while sanctions on Russia would be lifted and Moscow and Washington would enter in a series of \"long-term\" economic arrangements.\nThe document says Ukraine would not be allowed to join NATO, but would be eligible to join the European Union.\nIt also says elections must be held in Ukraine in 100 days.\nHere is the 28-point draft agreement in full:\n1. Ukraine's sovereignty will be confirmed.\n2. A comprehensive non-aggression agreement will be concluded between Russia, Ukraine and Europe. All ambiguities of the last 30 years will be considered settled.\n3. It is expected that Russia will not invade neighbouring countries and NATO will not expand further.\n4. A dialogue will be held between Russia and NATO, mediated by the United States, to resolve all security issues and create conditions for de-escalation in order to ensure global security and increase opportunities for cooperation and future economic development.\n5. Ukraine will receive reliable security guarantees.\n6. The size of the Ukrainian Armed Forces will be limited to 600,000 personnel.\n7. Ukraine agrees to enshrine in its constitution that it will not join NATO, and NATO agrees to include in its statutes a provision that Ukraine will not be admitted in the future.\n8. NATO agrees not to station troops in Ukraine.\n9. European fighter jets will be stationed in Poland.\n10. The US guarantee:\n- The US will receive compensation for the guarantee;\n- If Ukraine invades Russia, it will lose the guarantee;\n- If Russia invades Ukraine, in addition to a decisive coordinated military response, all global sanctions will be reinstated, recognition of the new territory and all other benefits of this deal will be revoked;\n- If Ukraine launches a missile at Moscow or St Petersburg without cause, the security guarantee will be deemed invalid.\n11. Ukraine is eligible for EU membership and will receive short-term preferential access to the European market while this issue is being considered.\n12. A powerful global package of measures to rebuild Ukraine, including but not limited to:\n- The creation of a Ukraine Development Fund to invest in fast-growing industries, including technology, data centres, and artificial intelligence.\n- The United States will cooperate with Ukraine to jointly rebuild, develop, modernise, and operate Ukraine's gas infrastructure, including pipelines and storage facilities.\n- Joint efforts to rehabilitate war-affected areas for the restoration, reconstruction and modernisation of cities and residential areas.\n- Infrastructure development.\n- Extraction of minerals and natural resources.\n- The World Bank will develop a special financing package to accelerate these efforts.\n13. Russia will be reintegrated into the global economy:\n- The lifting of sanctions will be discussed and agreed upon in stages and on a case-by-case basis.\n- The United States will enter into a long-term economic cooperation agreement for mutual development in the areas of energy, natural resources, infrastructure, artificial intelligence, data centres, rare earth metal extraction projects in the Arctic, and other mutually beneficial corporate opportunities.\n- Russia will be invited to rejoin the G8.\n14. Frozen funds will be used as follows:\n- $100bn (£76bn) in frozen Russian assets will be invested in US-led efforts to rebuild and invest in Ukraine;\n- The US will receive 50% of the profits from this venture. Europe will add $100bn (£76bn) to increase the amount of investment available for Ukraine's reconstruction. Frozen European funds will be unfrozen. The remainder of the frozen Russian funds will be invested in a separate US-Russian investment vehicle that will implement joint projects in specific areas. This fund will be aimed at strengthening relations and increasing common interests to create a strong incentive not to return to conflict.\n15. A joint American-Russian working group on security issues will be established to promote and ensure compliance with all provisions of this agreement.\n16. Russia will enshrine in law its policy of non-aggression towards Europe and Ukraine.\n17.

            "content": "28-Point Trump Ukraine-Russia Peace Plan\nThe following represents the complete 28-point framework presented by the Trump administration to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on November 20, 2025. This plan was drafted by Special Envoy Steve Witkoff in collaboration with Russian negotiator Kirill Dmitriev, with input from Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Jared Kushner.\nThe Complete 28 Points\n- Immediate Cessation of Hostilities\nAll parties agree to an immediate ceasefire along current battle lines. This represents the foundational requirement that must be accepted before any other provisions take effect.\n- Comprehensive Non-Aggression Agreement\nA comprehensive non-aggression agreement will be concluded between Russia, Ukraine, and Europe. All ambiguities and disputes of the last 30 years will be considered permanently settled, effectively drawing a line under three decades of post-Soviet tensions.\n- Mutual Security Commitments\nRussia commits not to invade neighboring countries, while NATO pledges not to expand further. This freezes the current NATO membership at existing levels and prevents any future enlargement, particularly regarding Ukraine and Georgia.\n- Russia-NATO Dialogue Mechanism\nA formal dialogue will be established between Russia and NATO, mediated by the United States, to resolve all security issues and create conditions for de-escalation. This aims to ensure global security and increase opportunities for cooperation and future economic development.\n- Prohibition on Ukraine's NATO Membership\nUkraine agrees never to join NATO. This represents a permanent abandonment of Ukraine's NATO aspirations, which have been a central foreign policy goal since 2014.\n- European Union Membership Rights\nUkraine's right to join the European Union will be confirmed and fast-tracked. Ukraine will receive immediate access to the European market pending full membership, providing economic integration even before political accession is complete.\n- Military Size Restrictions\nUkraine's military will be capped at 600,000 personnel. This represents approximately a 25 percent reduction from current force levels and includes all active-duty military branches.\n- Prohibition on Foreign Military Presence\nNo foreign troops or military bases will be permitted on Ukrainian territory. This effectively prevents any European or international peacekeeping force from being deployed to monitor the ceasefire or provide security guarantees.\n- Security Guarantees for Ukraine\nIn the event of future Russian aggression against Ukraine, there will be a \"decisive coordinated military response\" from the United States and European allies. Any attack on Ukraine would be viewed as an attack on the \"transatlantic community.\" However, this guarantee is voided if Ukraine invades Russia or launches missiles at Moscow or St. Petersburg. Recognition of new Russian territory and other benefits would also be canceled in case of Russian violation.\n- U.S.-Russia Nuclear Treaties Extension\nThe United States and Russia will agree to extend the validity of treaties on the non-proliferation and control of nuclear weapons, including the START I Treaty, maintaining strategic stability between the nuclear superpowers.\n- Creation of Joint Security Working Group\nA joint U.S.-Russia security working group will be established to address ongoing security concerns and build confidence between the former Cold War adversaries.\n- G8 Readmission for Russia\nRussia will be readmitted to the Group of Eight (G8), reversing its expulsion following the 2014 annexation of Crimea and restoring its participation in this forum of major economic powers.\n- Ukraine Development Fund\nCreation of a Ukraine Development Fund to invest in fast-growing industries, including technology, data centers, and artificial intelligence. The United States will cooperate with Ukraine to jointly rebuild, develop, modernize, and operate Ukraine's gas infrastructure, including pipelines and storage facilities. Joint efforts will rehabilitate war-affected areas for the restoration, reconstruction, and modernization of cities and residential areas.\n- Use of Frozen Russian Assets\nOne hundred billion dollars (US$100 billion) from frozen Russian Central Bank assets will be allocated for Ukrainian reconstruction. The European portion of frozen funds will be returned to Russia, while the remainder will be invested in a joint U.S.-Russian fund.\n- European Reconstruction Fund\nEurope will raise an additional 100 billion dollars for Ukrainian reconstruction, matching the contribution from frozen Russian assets.\n- U.S.-Russia Economic Cooperation\nThe United States will enter into long-term economic cooperation agreements with Russia for mutual development in areas of energy, natural resources, infrastructure, artificial intelligence, data centers, rare earth metal extraction projects in the Arctic, and other mutually beneficial corporate opportunities. Sanctions will be lifted in stages on a case-by-case basis.\n- Return to Global Economy\nBoth Ukraine and Russia will be provided financial opportunities to rejoin and participate fully in the global economy, with pathways for normalized trade relations and investment.\n- Ukraine's Non-Nuclear Status\nUkraine agrees to remain a non-nuclear state in accordance with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, permanently forgoing any nuclear weapons development.\n- Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant\nThe Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant will be relaunched under the supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and the electricity produced will be distributed equally between Russia and Ukraine on a 50-50 basis.\n- Educational and Cultural Programs\nBoth countries undertake to implement educational programs in schools and society aimed at promoting understanding and tolerance of different cultures and eliminating racism and prejudice. Specific provisions include:\n- Ukraine will adopt EU rules on religious tolerance and protection of linguistic minorities\n- Both countries will abolish all discriminatory measures and guarantee rights of Ukrainian and Russian media and education\n- All Nazi ideology and activities must be rejected and prohibited\n- Territorial Arrangements\nThis represents the most controversial element of the plan:\n- Crimea, Luhansk, and Donetsk will be recognized as de facto Russian territory, including by the United States\n- Kherson and Zaporizhzhia will be frozen along the line of contact, meaning de facto recognition of Russian control over occupied portions\n- Russia will relinquish other agreed territories it controls outside these five regions\n- Ukrainian forces will withdraw from the part of Donetsk Oblast they currently control; this withdrawal zone will become a neutral demilitarized buffer zone, internationally recognized as territory belonging to the Russian Federation, though Russian forces will not enter this demilitarized zone\n- Prohibition on Forcible Territorial Changes\nAfter agreeing on future territorial arrangements, both the Russian Federation and Ukraine undertake not to change these arrangements by force. Ukraine specifically agrees not to use military force to reclaim territories recognized as Russian under this agreement.\n- Freedom of Navigation and Commerce\nRussia will not prevent Ukraine from using the Dnipro River for commercial activities, and agreements will be reached on the free transport of grain across the Black Sea, ensuring Ukraine's agricultural exports can continue unimpeded.\n- Humanitarian Committee and Prisoner Exchange\nA humanitarian committee will be established to resolve outstanding issues:\n- All remaining prisoners and bodies will be exchanged on an \"all for all\" basis\n- All civilian detainees and hostages will be returned, including children\n- A family reunification program will be implemented\n- Measures will be taken to alleviate the suffering of victims of the conflict\n- Elections in Ukraine\nUkraine will hold presidential and parliamentary elections within 100 days of the agreement's signing, despite millions of citizens being displaced or living under occupation.\n- Universal Amnesty\nAll parties involved in this conflict will receive full amnesty for their actions during the war and agree not to make any claims or consider any complaints in the future. This effectively grants immunity for all potential war crimes committed during the conflict.\n- Legal Binding and Monitoring\nThis agreement will be legally binding. Its implementation will be monitored and guaranteed by the Peace Council, headed by President Donald J. Trump. Sanctions will be imposed for violations, though specific enforcement mechanisms remain undefined.\n- Ceasefire Implementation\nOnce all parties agree to this memorandum, the ceasefire will take effect immediately after both sides retreat to agreed points to begin implementation of the agreement. This means the ceasefire is contingent on acceptance of all 28 points and completion of initial withdrawals, not immediate upon signature.\nAdditional Context\nSeveral provisions contain sub-elements not captured in the simple numbering. The plan notably includes requirements that Russian become a second official language in Ukraine and that restrictions on the Russian Orthodox Church be lifted. The framework explicitly models its implementation on the recent Israel-Hamas ceasefire agreement, with President Trump personally chairing the Peace Council responsible for monitoring compliance.\nThe plan represents what the Institute for the Study of War characterizes as essentially demanding Ukraine's full capitulation to Russia's original war demands, as it contains no meaningful Russian concessions while requiring extensive Ukrainian territorial, military, and sovereignty sacrifices. The framework was negotiated without Ukrainian or European participation initially, though the Trump administration describes it as a \"living document\" subject to modification based on party feedback.\n|\nNEWSLETTER\n|\n| Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list |\n|\n|\n|"
