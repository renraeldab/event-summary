            "content": "The White House Announces White House Ballroom Construction to Begin\nWashington, D.C. — For 150 years, Presidents, Administrations, and White House Staff have longed for a large event space on the White House complex that can hold substantially more guests than currently allowed. President Donald J. Trump has expressed his commitment to solving this problem on behalf of future Administrations and the American people.\nThe White House is one of the most beautiful and historic buildings in the world, yet the White House is currently unable to host major functions honoring world leaders and other countries without having to install a large and unsightly tent approximately 100 yards away from the main building entrance. The White House State Ballroom will be a much-needed and exquisite addition of approximately 90,000 total square feet of ornately designed and carefully crafted space, with a seated capacity of 650 people — a significant increase from the 200-person seated capacity in the East Room of the White House.\nIn recent weeks, President Trump has held several meetings with members of the White House Staff, the National Park Service, the White House Military Office, and the United States Secret Service to discuss design features and planning.\nPresident Trump has chosen McCrery Architects as lead architect, which is well-known for their classical architectural design and based in our nation’s capital. CEO Jim McCrery said: “Presidents in the modern era have faced challenges hosting major events at the White House because it has been untouched since President Harry Truman. I am honored that President Trump has entrusted me to help bring this beautiful and necessary renovation to The People’s House, while preserving the elegance of its classical design and historical importance.”\nThe construction team will be headed by Clark Construction, and the engineering team will be led by AECOM.\nThe project will begin in September 2025, and it is expected to be completed long before the end of President Trump’s term.\nPresident Trump, and other patriot donors, have generously committed to donating the funds necessary to build this approximately $200 million dollar structure. The United States Secret Service will provide the necessary security enhancements and modifications.\nThe White House Ballroom will be substantially separated from the main building of the White House, but at the same time, it’s theme and architectural heritage will be almost identical. The site of the new ballroom will be where the small, heavily changed, and reconstructed East Wing currently sits. The East Wing was constructed in 1902 and has been renovated and changed many times, with a second story added in 1942.\nThe White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles said the following: “President Trump is a builder at heart and has an extraordinary eye for detail. The President and the Trump White House are fully committed to working with the appropriate organizations to preserving the special history of the White House while building a beautiful ballroom that can be enjoyed by future Administrations and generations of Americans to come.”\nThe White House will continue to provide the American public with updates on this project at whitehouse.gov/visit."

            "content": "Trump’s $200m ballroom: A history of home improvements at the White House\nThe White House has announced plans to build a new ballroom, fulfilling a long-term desire of Donald Trump’s.\nAfter paving over the Rose Garden and adding gold-filigree decorations to the Oval Office, US President Donald Trump will embark on his most dramatic addition to the White House yet – a new $200m ballroom to be built adjacent to the mansion’s East Wing.\nTrump, a former real estate developer, has repeatedly promised to build a “beautiful” ballroom at the White House. In 2016, he offered $100m during Barack Obama’s tenure for the project, which the then-president rejected.\nRecommended Stories\nlist of 4 items- list 1 of 4US Federal Reserve leaves rates unchanged despite Trump pressures\n- list 2 of 4Why Trump’s attacks on Jerome Powell are raising fears for the US economy\n- list 3 of 4Can Donald Trump fire Jerome Powell, US Federal Reserve chair?\n- list 4 of 4Who benefits from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, and who pays the price?\nBut in a briefing to reporters at the White House on Thursday, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that the “much needed and exquisite addition” to the White House will be approximately 90,000 square feet (8,360 square metres), with a seating capacity of 650.\nMost formal White House functions are currently held in the White House’s East Room, which can seat approximately 200 people. According to Leavitt, construction is expected to be completed “long before” the end of Trump’s term in office in January 2029.\nShe also said that the president and other donors would pay for the renovations, but declined to give details. Renderings provided by the White House show that the ballroom will be similar architecturally to the rest of the mansion.\nLeavitt said the ballroom would be built where the “East Wing currently sits”. When asked whether the project would require knocking down that section of the White House, she said the East Wing would need to be “modernised”.\n“The White House has a history of expansion to accommodate the changing needs of the nation’s chief executive,” Leslie Greene Bowman, who has served under four presidents on the Committee for the Preservation of the White House, told BBC News.\nSo, what have those been?\nWhen and how was the White House constructed?\nConstruction of the White House began in 1792, based on a design by the Irish-born architect James Hoban. Built by enslaved labourers and European craftsmen, it was first occupied by President John Adams in 1800, though it still wasn’t finished when he moved in.\nEnslaved labourers were forced to do physically demanding work on the White House, like quarrying and transporting stone and making bricks. They were typically hired out by their enslavers, who were paid for their labour.\nDuring the War of 1812 (also known as the Second War of Independence), British forces invaded Washington and set fire to the White House in August 1814.\nReconstruction began almost immediately afterwards under President James Madison, again led by Hoban.\nPresident James Monroe moved into the restored building in 1817, and later added the South Portico in 1824. The North Portico followed in 1829 during Andrew Jackson’s presidency, establishing the iconic facade of the White House as it is known today.\nOver the course of the 19th century, amendments were made slowly. Running water, gas lighting, and furnishings were gradually added. In 1891, under President Benjamin Harrison, electricity was installed in the White House.\nWhat changes were made to the White House in the 20th century?\nPresident Theodore Roosevelt made one of the most transformative changes to the building in 1902. He removed the old Victorian-style interiors and relocated the presidential offices from the second floor of the residence to a new West Wing.\nRoosevelt also expanded the State Dining Room – which could only hold 40 guests – by removing a staircase and increasing the size to a seating capacity of 100.\nRoosevelt’s renovations modernised the White House to suit the needs of a growing executive branch.\nThen, in 1909, William Howard Taft expanded Roosevelt’s West Wing and created the first Oval Office, a symbolic centrepiece of presidential power.\nThe biggest changes to the White House came under Harry Truman (president from 1945 to 1953). Truman gutted the inside of the building, leaving only the outer walls, while workers rebuilt the internal structure with steel beams and concrete floors.\nTruman also added a controversial second-floor balcony on the South Portico, sometimes called the “Truman Balcony”. Later presidents made more subtle, but still meaningful, changes to the White House.\nJohn F Kennedy and First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy led a restoration project focused on historical authenticity, refurbishing rooms with antiques.\nIn 1969, Richard Nixon added a bowling alley and upgraded the Situation Room.\nUnder Bill Clinton, the White House saw major technological upgrades, including improved security systems and internet connectivity. George W Bush renovated the press briefing room and restored several historical rooms, including the Abraham Lincoln Bedroom.\nIn recent years, Barack Obama installed wi-fi throughout the White House and the West Wing. Obama, a lifelong basketball enthusiast, also had part of the White House’s existing tennis courts adapted for basketball use.\nThough no official estimate exists, the cumulative costs of construction and renovations amount to roughly $250m (in current dollar terms). As such, maintaining the home – and office – of the US president comes with a significant price tag.\nWhat other building works are under way in Washington, DC?\nThe timing of the ballroom project is significant. Just a week ago, Trump seized on a sprawling renovation project undertaken by the US Federal Reserve (Fed) to criticise the central bank’s chair, Jay Powell.\nTrump zeroed in on the expensive price tag of the project – roughly $2.5bn to renovate two 1930s buildings. During a rare presidential visit to the central bank’s headquarters on July 24, Trump accused Powell of financial mismanagement.\nLast month, meanwhile, Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought (a Trump appointee) accused Powell of mishandling the “ostentatious” refurbishment of the Fed’s headquarters in Washington, DC.\nTrump has repeatedly demanded that the Fed lower interest rates by 3 percentage points, and has frequently raised the possibility of firing Powell, though the president has said he does not intend to do so. On July 22, Trump called the Fed chief a “numbskull”.\nDespite pressure from the White House, the Federal Reserve held interest rates steady at 4.25-4.50 percent on July 30, on par with economists’ expectations, as tariff-driven uncertainty weighs on the US economy."

            "content": "Construction crews have started demolishing part of the East Wing of the White House to make way for Donald Trump’s planned ballroom, prompting widespread criticism on social media and beyond.\nOne former lawmaker even called the renovation an “utter desecration”.\nThe Washington Post, which obtained and published photos of the demolition activity and cited two eyewitnesses, reported on Monday that demolition was under way, and shared an image showing construction in progress and parts of the exterior ripped down.\nOther images, including ones seen in the New York Post, also show demolition of parts of the East Wing.\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment from the Guardian.\nOn his Truth Social platform on Monday, Trump said “ground has been broken on the White House” to build the new ballroom.\n“I am honored to be the first President to finally get this much-needed project underway — with zero cost to the American Taxpayer! The White House Ballroom is being privately funded by many generous Patriots, Great American Companies, and, yours truly,” he added.\nEarlier, at a ceremony in Washington DC celebrating the NCAA champion Louisiana State University baseball team on Monday, Trump said his administration was planning to build “the most beautiful ballroom in the country”.\n“I didn’t know I’d be standing here right now because, right on the other side, you have a lot of construction going on, which you might hear periodically,” he said.\nPlans to build an enormous $250m ballroom addition to the White House – one of the largest projects at the White House in more than a century – emerged in July. At the time, press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the renovated space would span 90,000 sq ft (8,300 sq meters) and seat up to 650 people. Officials said it would be paid for by Trump and unnamed donors.\nOf the renovation, Trump said in July: “In the White House, for 150 years, they’ve wanted to have a ballroom.” He addded: “There’s never been a president that was good at ballrooms.\n“I’m good at building things and we’re going to build quickly and on time. It’ll be beautiful, top, top of the line.”\nReports broke in August that work would begin in September. It is expected to be completed before the end of Trump’s second term, in January 2029.\nTrump previously claimed that the new structure would not “interfere with the current building”, according to the Washington Post.\n“It’ll be near it but not touching it – and pays total respect to the existing building, which I’m the biggest fan of,” Trump said during an executive order signing in July, according to the Post. “It’s my favorite. It’s my favorite place. I love it.”\nEarlier this month, Trump hosted a dinner at the White House for donors funding the ballroom. During the event, he reportedly opened the curtains of the East Room to show where construction on the ballroom had started. He told the guests that the new venue would feature bulletproof glass, accommodate 1,000 people and be capable of hosting a presidential inauguration.\nGuests at the dinner reportedly included representatives from Amazon, Apple, Meta, Google, Microsoft, Palantir and Lockheed Martin.\nConcerns and criticisms over Trump’s renovation plans have come from lawmakers and from social media.\nDemocratic congressman Mark Takano of California proposed a bill that would prohibit the use of federal funds for any construction or renovation at the White House during a government shutdown, unless the work is directly related to health or safety. Monday marked day 20 of the government shutdown.\nJoe Walsh, a former Republican member of Congress, called the renovation an “utter desecration”.\n“If I ran for President in 2028, I’d run on taking a bulldozer to Trump’s ballroom, an utter desecration of the peoples’ house,” Walsh said in a post on X on Monday, reacting to a picture showing part of the White House being demolished.\n“In fact, I’d invite the American people one weekend to bring their own sledgehammers & crowbars to the White House to help tear that abomination down.”\n“Wealth & income inequality is at record highs in America, but glad we’re spending $250m on a vanity project,” said human rights lawyer Qasim Rashid."

Trump reiterated in the interview that he will personally help pay for the addition. Private donors — “patriots,” as the White House has called them — are also expected to chip in.\nA former real estate developer, Trump has taken a personal interest in the ballroom’s construction.\nWork has already begun, as Trump noted to reporters gathered Friday on the South Lawn.\n“Right there you see all the trucks,” he said. “They just started construction of the new ballroom for the White House.”\nThe ballroom represents the biggest change to the White House exterior since the East Wing was expanded under Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1942. It will take the place of the East Wing, which has traditionally served as office space for the first lady and her staff.\nTrump is coming off a fraught week in which he lost his friend and political ally Charlie Kirk in an assassination. On Tuesday, he is due to leave for England, where he and first lady Melania Trump will be the guests at a state banquet hosted by King Charles and Queen Camilla at Windsor Castle.\nTrump will be the first American president to have been invited for two state visits; his first took place in 2019 at the invitation of Queen Elizabeth, who died three years later.\n“I look forward to saying hello to Charles and Camilla,” Trump told NBC News.\n“It’s going to be incredible. It’s such a great honor.”"

Snopes readers also wrote in about the topic.\nHowever, we found no credible evidence that the Trump administration's proposed $200 million ballroom would be paid for using taxpayers' money.\nRather, both Trump and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump and private donors would pay for the project. The Rapid Response 47 X account, an official account of the Trump administration, wrote (archived) in a July 31 post that the project would be \"fully funded by President Trump and other private donors — not taxpayers.\"\nIt was unclear at the time of this writing whether the $200 million amount included costs for \"enhancements and modifications\" that the White House statement said the U.S. Secret Service, a taxpayer -unded government agency, would provide. We reached out to the White House for clarification on this point and await a reply.\nKaroline Leavitt and the White House announced the project, called the White House State Ballroom, on July 31, 2025. According to the White House statement, the room would sit near the current East Wing and seat 650 people — more than three times as many as the current East Room, which seats 200 people. The White House statement described the new ballroom as an \"exquisite addition of approximately 90,000 total square feet of ornately designed and carefully crafted space.\"\nOn funding, the White House statement said, \"President Trump, and other patriot donors, have generously committed to donating the funds necessary to build this approximately $200 million dollar structure. The United States Secret Service will provide the necessary security enhancements and modifications.\"\nTrump himself also spoke about the ballroom while signing an executive order on July 31 (time code 21:46, our emphasis):\nReporter: Mr. President, can you talk about your plans for the new ballroom that was announced today? The $200 million, that's going to be paid for by yourself —\nTrump: By me, yeah.\nReporter: — private donations?\nTrump: It's a private thing, yeah, I'll do it and we'll probably have some donors or whatever, but it's about $200 million. We've been planning it for a long time, they've wanted a ballroom at the White House for more than 150 years but there's never been a president that was good at ballrooms. (unintelligible) really good. In fact, I looked at one we just built in Turnberry in Scotland and it's incredible. We're good at building, I'm good at building things and we'll get it built quickly and on time, it'll be beautiful, top of the line.\nNearly two months earlier, on June 6, 2025, Trump posted on his social media network Truth Social, \"Just inspected the site of the new Ballroom that will be built, compliments of a man known as Donald J. Trump, at the White House.\"\nDays before the White House announcement, Trump teased the idea while meeting with Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, at his Trump Turnberry resort in Scotland (which, he said, had recently had its own ballroom fitted). Trump said (video time code 1:43), \"We're building a great ballroom at the White House. The White House has wanted a ballroom for 150 years, but they never had a real estate person, you know, nobody, no president knew how to build a ballroom.\" Trump did not mention the financing of the project while speaking at Turnberry.\nTrump has floated ideas for a ballroom at the White House since at least 2010, according to former U.S. President Barack Obama's senior adviser David Axelrod. According to Axelrod, Trump offered to build \"a ballroom you can assemble and take apart\" in 2010.\nTrump recounted the encounter to ABC News in 2011, according to a New York Post article. At that time, Trump reportedly priced the project at $100 million, half the 2025 ballroom estimate.\nThe idea surfaced again in 2016, when Obama's press secretary Josh Earnest laughed off (video time code 36:53) another Trump offer of a ballroom as \"not something that was at all seriously considered.\"\n\"I'm not sure that it would be appropriate to have a shiny gold Trump sign on any part of the White House,\" Earnest said.\nThe White House's July 2025 announcement included illustrations of the proposed exterior and interior of the White House State Ballroom by McCrery Architects. The illustrations showed plans for a gold-accented dining room, though they did not include any gold Trump signs."

So, for decades, when the White House needed more capacity for a state dinner or other large event, they would take it outdoors, usually putting up large fancy tents, complete with flooring and chandeliers.\nOnce completed, the White House says the new ballroom will seat 650 guests.\n\"The White House State Ballroom will be a much-needed and exquisite addition of approximately 90,000 total square feet of innately designed and carefully crafted space,\" according to a statement read by press secretary Karoline Leavitt. She said the cost would be footed by Trump himself as well as \"other patriot donors.\" Leavitt said construction would finish \"long before\" the end of Trump's term.\nIt will be located where the East Wing of the White House currently sits, displacing offices. That space has been renovated many times over the years, according to the White House statement.\nFor Trump, this marks the culmination of a long quest to solve the problem of state dinners being held in tents he considers unsightly and overpriced. Back in 2010, he called David Axelrod, an adviser to then-President Barack Obama, to offer his services building a ballroom.\n\" 'You know, you have these state dinners and you have them in these little tents,' \" Axelrod recalled Trump telling him. \"And he said, 'You know, I build ballrooms. I build the greatest ballrooms and you can come down to Florida to see them.' \"\nAxelrod handed the pitch off to someone else, who didn't follow up. It's something he says he regrets, though, not because he thought a ballroom was a good idea.\n\"Tent never bothered me,\" Axelrod said.\nBut Trump never forgot the slight. Earlier this year, speaking to a group of female athletes in the East Room, Trump bemoaned the lack of a larger space.\n\"This was going to be the reception room. I was going to build a beautiful, beautiful ballroom like I have at Mar-a-Lago,\" Trump said. \"It was going to cost about $100 million. I offered to do it, and I never heard back.\"\nThis past weekend, as Trump was preparing to hash out the final details of a trade deal with European Council President Ursula von der Leyen at his Turnberry golf course in Scotland, he took a detour to boast about the cavernous room where they were sitting.\n\"You know, we just built this ballroom, and we're building a great ballroom at the White House,\" Trump said.\nTrump told her he was uniquely qualified to bring a ballroom to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\"No president knew how to build a ballroom,\" Trump told von der Leyen. \"I could take this one, drop it right down there, and it would be beautiful.\"\nIt turns out, Trump was already well on his way to executing on a different ballroom at the people's house. The White House says that in recent weeks, Trump has held several meetings with the White House staff, National Park Service, the White House Military Office and the U.S. Secret Service to discuss the design and other planning details. On Thursday afternoon, he told reporters the ballroom is a \"great legacy project.\"\nThis is just the latest example of Trump efforts to put an enduring stamp on the White House. Trump has already made the Oval Office much more golden, added new medallions to the light fixtures in the Cabinet Room, laid paving stones over where the grass used to be in the Rose Garden and erected giant new flagpoles on the north and south lawns.\nThe Rose Garden project is on pace to be completed in early August. The Trust for the National Mall is raising private donations to cover the cost of the project."

            "content": "White House unveils plans for new $200m ballroom\nThe White House has announced plans to build a $200m (£151m) new ballroom, fulfilling an often-repeated desire of US President Donald Trump.\nThe new ballroom will be built alongside a \"modernised\" East Wing of the White House, which currently houses the offices of First Lady Melania Trump and other key White House posts.\nThe money will be donated directly by Trump and other so-far anonymous donors, with work beginning in September, according to Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt.\nTrump has repeatedly promised to build a \"beautiful\" ballroom at the White House, and in 2016 offered to pay $100m during Barack Obama's administration - which the then-President rejected.\nIn a briefing for reporters at the White House on Thursday, Leavitt said that the \"much needed and exquisite addition\" to the White House will be approximately 90,000 sq ft (8,360 sq m) with a seating capacity of about 650.\nMany formal White House functions are held in the White House's East Room, which can seat approximately 200 people.\nThe new ballroom, Leavitt added, would also eliminate the need for a \"large and unsightly tent\" to be installed for state dinners and other large events, which sometimes include world leaders.\nAccording to Leavitt, construction is expected to be completed \"long before\" the end of Trump's term in office in January 2029.\n\"The President and the Trump White House are fully committed to working with the appropriate organisations to preserving the special history of the White House, while building a beautiful ballroom that can be enjoyed by future administrations and generations of Americans to come,\" Chief of Staff Susie Wiles said in a statement.\nRenderings provided by the White House show that the ballroom will be similar architecturally to the rest of the White House, with a lavish interior including chandeliers and ornate columns.\n\"The White House has a history of expansion to accommodate the changing needs of the nation's chief executive,\" Leslie Greene Bowman, who has served under four presidents on the Committee for the Preservation of the White House, told the BBC.\n\"I hope and trust that any proposed changes will honor and preserve the existing walls that have witnessed so much history. They are precious vessels of our legacy as a democracy.\"\nOffices housed in the East Wing of the White House adjacent to the construction - including that of First Lady Melania Trump - will be temporarily re-located.\nPresident Trump has repeatedly voiced his wishes for a new ballroom as part of renovations to the White House, which has already seen the installation of two large flagpoles, new gold decorations in the Oval Office and the bulldozing and paving over of the famed Rose Garden.\n\"There's never been a President that's good at ballrooms,\" Trump said at an event at the White House on Thursday. \"I'm good at building things.\"\nTrump added that \"they've always had to get tents\" for large events at the White House, which he described as a disaster. \"It's not a pretty sight.\"\nEarlier this week during a Scotland meeting with European Council President Ursula Van der Leyen, Trump told her that \"we're building a great ballroom at the White House\"\n\"No president knew how to build a ballroom,\" Trump said while sitting in another ballroom at his Turnberry golf resort. \"I could take this one, drop it right down there, and it would be beautiful.\"\nIn 2016, when on the campaign trail during the administration of Barack Obama, Trump famously offered to contribute $100m for the construction of a new ballroom for the White House to use to host events.\nAt the time, then-Press Secretary Josh Earnest said that the suggestion was \"not something that was at all seriously considered\".\n\"I'm not sure that it would be appropriate to have a shiny gold Trump sign…on any part of the White House,\" Earnest told reporters.\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

            "content": "White House demolition begins for new ballroom. Will it look like Mar-a-Lago? See photos.\nConstruction on President Donald Trump's new White House ballroom is underway.\nTrump had previously said the new ballroom wouldn't impact the existing White House structure, but a wall of the East Wing has been demolished, images show.\nTrump has already made some other changes at the White House, like golden adornments in the Oval Office and a new patio in the Rose Garden, both of which mirror the aesthetic of his Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago.\nWill the new ballroom in Washington, D.C., mirror that of his Winter White House? See photos of the ballroom renderings for DC and photos from inside the Donald J. Trump ballroom at Mar-a-Lago:\nThe mystery of Mar-a-Lago: What to know about President Trump's Florida home, private club\nWhat is Trump doing to the White House? East Wing wall demolished\nTrump announced in July that he was building a new ballroom at the White House. He has long complained that large-scale events at the White House are held in tents.\nTrump said construction began Oct. 20 by removing a wall of the East Wing. He called it \"a knock out panel, and that goes right into the ballroom.\"\nThe East Wing traditionally houses the first lady's office.\nSee photos of the demolition underway:\nSee renderings of the new White House ballroom\nAt a July briefing with reporters, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the ballroom would be separate from the rest of the White House but \"its theme and architectural heritage will be almost identical.\"\nShe also said it would hold 650 guests, but Trump later told NBC News the capacity would be \"a little bigger,\" and able to hold 900 guests.\nSee the renderings of the new ballroom:\nBallroom in Mar-a-Lago also adorned in gold: See photos\nTrump also renovated Mar-a-Lago to add a ballroom, completed in late 2004, almost 10 years after the club opened. The Palm Beach Daily News reported Trump ran into a similar issue he has bemoaned at the White House: there wasn't a big enough space to host large events inside and they had to use a large tent instead.\n\"We need a ballroom because of the success of Mar-a-Lago. It has been so successful that the crowds are potentially hazardous to the facility, and the ballroom could remedy this problem,\" Trump told the Palm Beach Daily News in 1996.\nNews reports indicate the first major event in the new ballroom was a Near Year's Eve party to ring in 2005. Trump and first lady Melania Trump held their wedding reception in the ballroom shortly after.\nSee photos of the Donald J. Trump ballroom at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida.\nIs Trump paying for the ballroom?\nYes, Trump has said he will pay for the ballroom with his own money and private donations. It is projected to cost $250 million.\nContributing: Zac Anderson, Joey Garrison and James Powel, USA TODAY, and Kristina Webb, Palm Beach Daily News\nKinsey Crowley is the Trump Connect reporter for the USA TODAY Network.
